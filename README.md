# Private PM (*Private* Private Message)
For more information, see [privatepm.com](https://privatepm.com) and the [about](https://privatepm.com/about) page.

PrivatePM is a simple tool that encrypts a message, but only allows decryption for a period of time. Messages are *never* sent to the server. Encryption is done completely client side. In order to enforce the expiration time, the encryption key is stored on the server. The actual encrypted message is stored in the URL.
